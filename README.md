# DND Character Creator

This is a simple TUI for creating a dnd character, originally written for a CS class in 2015.  I will be updating this and use it to work on creating build files and document that process here.

Language: C++

Libraries: 

Build process: -TBD-

## Notes

- not sure what this was originally built with, but it was all originally compiled on windows so needed tweaks to do a base g++ CL compile with bash
- vscode properties are also not happy and needed some tweaks just for this.  Still issue with intellisense parsing code correctly
- as of 1-7-23
  - Test compile worked with no special flags
  - some bugs notcied in output but it compiled and ran cleanish
  - also successfully exported in both formats
